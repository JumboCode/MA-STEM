# MA STEM
### A 2018-2019 JumboCode project led by Caroline Kaufman and Dan Cetlin

## Project Overview
We are working with the Central Massachussetts STEM Network, an affiliate of 
the Worcester Polytechnic Institute STEM Education Center, to build a web
application that allows students and adult learners to visualize careers in 
STEM fields and identify resources to help them build careers in STEM. The
application will make the resources of the ["Designing My Future"](https://www.wpi.edu/news/calendar/events/designing-my-future-stem-career-expo-families-and-students-worcester) STEM career expo available and accessible for families
whether or not they were able to attend the in person event. This project
aims to help students identify steps they can take toward a STEM career that
are tailored to their location and interests.

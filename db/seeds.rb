  description: "No margarita is complete without fresh-squeezed lime juice—there’s something about the sour punch of citrus that goes so well with the smokiness of tequila. To stir things up, try adding pineapple juice to the mix and muddling in some jalapeño peppers for a little heat.",
  steps: "Pour the lime juice and jalapeños into a shaker and muddle with the back of a wood spoon. Fill with ice. Pour in tequila, pineapple juice, and Grand Marnier. Shake until chilled. Dip the rim of a rocks glass in water, then dip it in coarse salt. Fill the glass with ice, and strain the cocktail into the glass. Garnish with pineapple wedge and peel and jalapeño slices.",
